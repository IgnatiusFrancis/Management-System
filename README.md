Turborepo Starter
This Turborepo starter is maintained by the Turborepo core team. It is tailored for a full-stack application, where the frontend and backend are managed in the same monorepo. It integrates deployment using Vercel (for frontend) and Render (for backend).

Using this example
Run the following command to create your Turborepo project: npx create-turbo@latest

Dependencies:
Run npm install at each dir to install dependecies for the various app dir

Apps and Packages
frontend: A Next.js app for the web frontend (hosted on Vercel).

backend: A Node.js API backend using Express.js (hosted on Render).

Develop
To run all apps and packages in development mode (for both frontend and backend), use: npm run dev

Deployment to Vercel (Frontend) and Render (Backend)
This Turborepo is set up to deploy your frontend and backend to different services:

Frontend (Next.js): Deployed to Vercel.

Backend (Express.js): Deployed to Render.

To set this up:

Frontend: Push the frontend app to a Git repository connected to Vercel, and configure automatic deployment on Vercel's dashboard.

Backend: Push the backend app to a Git repository connected to Render, and configure automatic deployment on Render's dashboard.

Vercel will handle the frontend (Next.js) deployment, while Render will handle the backend (Express.js) API deployment.
